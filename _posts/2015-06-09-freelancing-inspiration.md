I quit my cushy engineering job a month and half ago to be an independent developer. It wasn't an overnight decision and
a lot of thought and ramp up went into it. My long game is to bootstrap a recurring revenue product but for now this is
 what pays the bills. I'll detail that path in another post but this one is about being a hired gun.

If you are looking for inspiration then I've got a list of freelancing resources for you.
