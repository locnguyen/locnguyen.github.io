I started the [ReactJS-OC](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-OC) meetup group this month and we just had our first gathering.
I gave a talk on the fundamental concepts of ReactJS and how to get started. There were some technical difficulties but
we managed to work through them. Humongous thanks to [PeopleSpace](http://peoplespace.us) and [Codazen](http://codezen.com)
for sponsoring with a venue and food, respectively.
