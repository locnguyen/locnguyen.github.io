I'm a software engineer in Orange County, CA. I get my jollies building stuff with WMDs such as Ruby, NodeJS
and AngularJS. I slip to the dark side of Java occasionally but I'm working hard on that.

Open source is core to how I deliver products for my clients. I'm a real software geek and I can talk about it
all day and on weekends too. I love interacting with peers so much I organize
[AngularJS-OC](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-OC), present at  meetups, and help with conferences and
hackathons.
